## **Overview**
This project is a deep learning-based image classification task to distinguish between images of dogs and cats. It uses the **Dogs vs. Cats dataset** from Kaggle, which contains labeled images of dogs and cats for training and testing.

## **Dataset**
- **Source:** [Dogs vs. Cats Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/salader/dogs-vs-cats)
- **Contents:**
  - **Training Set:** 25,000 images (12,500 dogs + 12,500 cats)
  - **Testing Set:** 12,500 images (unlabeled)

## **Project Workflow**
1. **Dataset Import & Preprocessing** 🛠️  
   - Download and extract the dataset from Kaggle.  
   - Resize images for uniformity (e.g., 128x128 pixels).  
   - Apply data augmentation techniques to improve model generalization.

2. **Model Selection & Training** 🧠  
   - Use **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for feature extraction.  
   - Possible architectures: **VGG16, ResNet50, EfficientNet, or a custom CNN.**  
   - Train using **Cross-Entropy Loss** and optimize with **Adam/SGD**.

3. **Evaluation & Testing** 📊  
   - Assess performance using **accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score**.  
   - Visualize results with confusion matrices and sample predictions.

4. **Deployment (Optional)** 🚀  
   - Deploy the model using **Flask, FastAPI, or TensorFlow.js**.  
   - Create a simple web app to classify new images.

## **Results & Insights**
- Expected accuracy: **85-95%** with a well-trained CNN.
- Common misclassifications may occur with **blurry or ambiguous images**.
- Fine-tuning pre-trained models like **ResNet** or **MobileNet** improves results.

## **Future Improvements**
🔹 Use **Transfer Learning** with state-of-the-art models.  
🔹 Experiment with **GANs** for data augmentation.  
🔹 Deploy as a **real-time image classification web app**.
