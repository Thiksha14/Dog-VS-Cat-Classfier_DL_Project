# Dog vs Cat Classifier - Deep Learning Project  

## **Project Overview**  
This project focuses on building a **deep learning model** to classify images of **dogs and cats** using **TensorFlow** and **Keras**. We use **CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks)** to achieve high accuracy in distinguishing between the two categories.  

---

## **Dataset**  
We use the **Dogs vs Cats dataset** from Kaggle, which contains **25,000 images** of dogs and cats. The dataset is split into:  
- **Training Set**: 80% of the images  
- **Validation Set**: 10% of the images  
- **Test Set**: 10% of the images  

## **Preprocessing Steps:**  
- Resized all images to **(224, 224, 3)**  

## 🔥 **Technologies Used**  
- Python  
- TensorFlow & Keras  
- OpenCV & Matplotlib  
- Google Colab
